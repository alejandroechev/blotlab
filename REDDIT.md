## Post 1: r/labrats

**Title:** I built a free browser-based western blot densitometry tool

**Body:**

I built BlotLab — a free web app for western blot quantification with rolling ball background subtraction, automatic lane detection, band ROI selection, and normalization to loading controls. Everything runs in the browser.

Upload your blot image, it detects lanes and bands, you pick your loading control (GAPDH, actin, etc.), and it gives you normalized fold changes. No install, no login, no data uploaded to any server — everything runs client-side.

Would love feedback from people who actually quantify westerns regularly — what would make this worth switching to?

## Post 2: r/biology

**Title:** Free browser tool for western blot densitometry — automatic lane detection, background subtraction, normalization

**Body:**

I built a free, open-source web app for western blot quantification. It does rolling ball background subtraction, automatic lane/band detection, integrated intensity measurement, and normalization to loading controls — all in your browser with no install.

Upload your image and run the workflow directly in the app. Just drag and drop your blot image.

What features would make this actually useful for your lab work?

## Post 3: r/cellbiology

**Title:** Built a free western blot quantification tool that runs in your browser — looking for feedback

**Body:**

I made BlotLab — a free browser-based tool for western blot densitometry. It handles background subtraction (rolling ball), lane detection, band ROI measurement, and fold change calculation with loading control normalization.

Everything runs client-side — your images never leave your computer. No account needed, no software to install.

I'd love to hear what cell biologists need from a densitometry tool — what's painful about your current workflow?

## Updated Post Footer (add to all posts)

> **A note on this project:** I'm a software engineer exploring what happens when you use AI to build professional tools in domains you're not an expert in. I've built 14 of these so far — across civil engineering, life sciences, optics, and petroleum engineering — and I'm documenting the journey.
>
> The biggest lesson: AI makes coding easy, but **domain expertise is irreplaceable.** These tools work, but they'd be *much* better if built by someone who actually works in this field. If you're a practitioner frustrated by expensive legacy tools, you might be surprised what you can build with AI now.
